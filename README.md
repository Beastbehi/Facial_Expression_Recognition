# Facial_Expression_Recognition

This are some python codes of one kaggle competition:Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge
This project is built on Keras which is a deep learning frame. There are three DNN models: VGG16, Inception, Xception and all of them are handmade rather than using the built-in function of Keras. After training and test, the final result is 67% which is encouraging.
